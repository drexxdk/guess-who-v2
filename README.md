- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with cookie-based sessions
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account ([create one here](https://database.new))

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd guess-who-v2
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [database.new](https://database.new)
   - Run the database migrations (found in SQL files in the project)
   - Get your project URL and anon key from the API settings

   **Configure Email Authentication:**

   To enable email confirmations for new user sign-ups:
   1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Providers** > **Email**
   3. Make sure **Enable Email provider** is ON
   4. Enable **Confirm email** (this ensures users must verify their email)
   5. Optionally customize the email templates in **Authentication** > **Email Templates**

   **Email Configuration Options:**
   - **Development**: Supabase provides a built-in email service (limited sending, emails may go to spam)
   - **Production**: Configure a custom SMTP provider in **Project Settings** > **Auth** for reliable email delivery:
     - Recommended providers: SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun, Postmark
     - This prevents emails from being marked as spam and provides better deliverability

   **Site URL Configuration:**

   In **Authentication** > **URL Configuration**, set:
   - **Site URL**: Your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
   - **Redirect URLs**: Add allowed redirect URLs including `http://localhost:3000/**` for development

4. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY]
   ```

5. **Optional: Configure MCP Server for AI Assistants**

   If you're using VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or similar AI assistants that support Model Context Protocol (MCP):

   1. Copy `.vscode/mcp.json.example` to `.vscode/mcp.json`
   2. Get your Supabase service role key from [Project Settings > API](https://app.supabase.com)
   3. Update the configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "supabase": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@0.6.2"],
         "env": {
           "SUPABASE_URL": "your-supabase-project-url",
           "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-service-role-key"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   ⚠️ **Security Note**: `mcp.json` is gitignored and runs only on your local machine. Never commit this file or share your service role key.

6. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Database Setup

The app requires several database tables. You'll need to run migrations in your Supabase SQL Editor to set up:

- `groups` - Group definitions
- `people` - People within groups
- `game_sessions` - Active game sessions
- `game_answers` - Player answers and scores

## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues

**Sign-up confirmation emails not being sent?**

1. **Check Supabase Auth Settings**:
   - Go to **Authentication** > **Providers** > **Email**
   - Ensure **Confirm email** is enabled
   - Check that **Enable Email provider** is ON

2. **Check Email Templates**:
   - Go to **Authentication** > **Email Templates**
   - Verify the "Confirm signup" template is enabled and configured
   - Test by clicking "Send test email"

3. **Check Spam Folder**:
   - Development emails from Supabase often end up in spam
   - Check junk/spam folders
   - For Gmail, check the Promotions tab

4. **For Production**:
   - Configure custom SMTP in **Project Settings** > **Auth**
   - Use a reputable email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
   - Verify your domain to improve deliverability

5. **Check Supabase Logs**:
   - Go to **Logs** > **Auth Logs** in your Supabase dashboard
   - Look for sign-up events and any error messages

6. **Resend Confirmation**:
   - Users can click "Resend confirmation email" on the sign-up success page
   - Or use the Supabase auth dashboard to manually send confirmation emails

## AI Development Guidelines

**For AI assistants (Claude, etc.):**

This is a **social learning game**, not a competitive application. Key context:

- The purpose is helping people get to know each other
- Target use cases: new employees, new students, team building
- Scores and timing are just for engagement, not competition
- Focus should be on ease of use and social connection
